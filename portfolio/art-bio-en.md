## About me
- I am an electronics and multimedia engineer, also involved in artistic projects. My expertise is sound. For many years, I have collaborated with cultural and educational institutions as well as individual artists, supporting them in the production of exhibitions and projects that integrate electronic or multimedia systems. I am eager to share my knowledge acquired both during formal education and through professional experience, not only in the realms of culture. I write programs, draw objects, design circuits, adjust receivers and transmitters, integrate components, and sometimes, with no less satisfaction, drill a hole for a cable in concrete or wood. I enjoy critical and creative thinking as well as quiet engagement in the process.
- In my artistic endeavors I aim to provide sensory organic experiences, thus sound is my primary medium of expression
